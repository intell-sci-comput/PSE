## Method Descriptions

1. **TPSR (Transformer-based Planning for Symbolic Regression)**: An innovative approach by Shojaee et al. that effectively leverages transformer architectures to create a principled planning framework for symbolic regression. This method represents a notable advancement in the field, demonstrating strong capabilities in discovering interpretable equations while maintaining computational efficiency.

2. **wAIC (Autonomous inference with AIC)**: A sophisticated method published in Nature Computational Science by Gao and Yan that addresses the challenging problem of inferring complex network dynamics from incomplete and noisy data. This method's theoretical foundation and empirical results have established it as an important benchmark in scientific discovery.

3. **DGSR (Deep Generative Symbolic Regression)**: An approach by Holt et al. that utilizes deep generative modeling to produce symbolic expressions, offering interesting capabilities for equation discovery.

4. **NGGP (Neural-Guided Genetic Programming)**: A method by Mundhenk et al. that combines deep reinforcement learning with genetic programming, creating an enhanced symbolic regression framework.

5. **PySR**: A practical and widely-used interpretable machine learning library developed by Cranmer that provides efficient symbolic regression capabilities.

6. **uDSR (unified Deep Symbolic Regression)**: A framework by Landajuela et al. that attempts to unify different aspects of deep symbolic regression into a cohesive approach.

7. **SPL (Symbolic Physics Learner)**: A search-based approach by Sun et al. that employs Monte Carlo tree search techniques to discover governing equations in physical systems.
