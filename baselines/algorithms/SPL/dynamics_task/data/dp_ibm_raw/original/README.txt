Coordinate data have 6 columns, they are 
(y_red, x_red), (y_green, x_green), (y_blue, x_blue).
All the y-coordinates are given reversely, that means the high positions have low values.
Theta files contain 2 columns, they are theta 1 and theta 2 (0 = vertical downwards, counter-clockwise is positive)
